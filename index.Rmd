description: "Here you will find a description of my research, and
  resources for my service projects such as the UCI Womxn's Caucus, and UCI's Methods
  and Coding Group. I believe in rigorous Political Science research on identity, public opinion, and political behavior that is informed by feminst theory. For me, this means quantitative research methods and data analysis that exposes shortcomings of the democratic promise in the U.S., and highlights the revolutionary knowledge production of marginalized groups. Further, as a scholar, I prioritize mentorship and service which I believe to be the cornerstones of a better Academy."
