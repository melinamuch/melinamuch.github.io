I graduated from [Francis Marion University](https://www.fmarion.edu/) with a B.A. in both Political Science and Economics in 2018. In 2018 I also began working toward my Ph.D. in Political Science at [UC Irvine](https://www.polisci.uci.edu/), where I am investigating statistical methods for the study of political behavior and attidues using the framework intersectionality and multidimensional identities (namely race and gender). I am studying under [Dr. Ines Levin](https://sites.uci.edu/ilevin/) and [Dr. Michael Tesler](http://faculty.sites.uci.edu/mtesler/files/2018/02/cv_218.pdf) at UCI. I expect to graduate attain my Ph.D. by 2024.
