description: "Here you will find a description of my research, and
  resources for my service projects such as the UCI Womxn's Caucus, and UCI's Methods
  and Coding Group. I believe in rigorous Political Science research informed by feminst theory, and    research that works to make lives better. For me, this means quantitative research and data analysis that exposes opression, seeks to remedy structural inequality, and highlights the revolutionary power of marginalized groups."
