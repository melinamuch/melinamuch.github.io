      "contents": "\nI graduated from Francis Marion University with a B.A. in both Political Science and Economics in 2018. I was a Blackwell Award recipient at FMU reflecting that I was the top student in my graduating class. In 2018 I also began working toward my Ph.D. in Political Science at UC Irvine, where I am investigating statistical methods for the study of political behavior and attidues using the framework intersectionality and multidimensional identities (namely race and gender). I am studying under Dr. Ines Levin and Dr. Michael Tesler at UCI. I expect to graduate attain my Ph.D. by 2024.\nHere is my CV, enjoy this site! You will find tabs for my current endevours, including service projects such as the UCI Womxn’s Caucus, and UCI Political Science Methods and Coding Reading Group!\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Here you will find a description of my research, and resources for my service projects such as the UCI Womxn's Caucus, and UCI's Methods and Coding Group. I believe in rigorous Political Science research on identity, public opinion, and political behavior that is informed by feminst theory. For me, this means quantitative research methods and data analysis that exposes shortcomings of the democratic promise in the U.S., and highlights the revolutionary knowledge production of marginalized groups. Further, as a scholar, I prioritize mentorship and service which I believe to be the cornerstones of a better Academy.",

      "author": [],
      "contents": "\nThis is a collaborative group meant to cross the bridges of Political Science subfields to connect folks who are wanting or are actively using quantitative methods in their work. Our goals for the group are to reduce barriers and encourage the use of quant while recognizing that Political Methodology’s history as a subfield has lacked diversity and accessibility to womxn and POC.\nWe are looking to embrace our collective knowledge to teach each other general methods, coding hacks, and tricks to make all of our lives easier. This space will use R, as R’s open nature allows for everyone to access the software with no financial barriers. Liz and I will be hosting a few meetings, as well as allowing other grad students to pitch short hacks or packages they find helpful. We will also hold the space to read and discuss big issues/articles in Political Methodology.\nMeeting Schedulue:\nDecember 10th 3:00-4:00 PM on Github and Version Control\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nOur continued aim for the Political Science Womxn’s Caucus has been to serve as a much-needed platform to engage with issues of diversity – race, gender, sexuality, etc. – through the lens of intersectionality. In our third year of the Womxn’s Caucus, we strive to strengthen our own department’s support of womxn graduate students and build new, diverse, interdisciplinary connections within the School of Social Sciences. As previously outlined, the Womxn’s Caucus serves a vital purpose in our department as a space which empowers womxn graduate students—helping them navigate their academic endeavors in a safe,comfortable environment that validates their everyday struggles and fosters their growth and learning. Please email me at mmuch@uci.edu or jtaghvai@uci.edu for invites to these events.\nEvent Schedule\nWelcome Event: November 6th 4:00 pm\nInvited Talk with Dr. Julia Jordan Zachery: December 2nd 11-12:30 pm PST\n\n\n\n",
