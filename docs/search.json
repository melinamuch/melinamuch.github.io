      "contents": "\nI graduated from Francis Marion University with a B.A. in both Political Science and Economics in 2018. In 2018 I also began working toward my Ph.D. in Political Science at UC Irvine, where I am investigating statistical methods for the study of political behavior and attidues using the framework intersectionality and multidimensional identities (namely race and gender). I am studying under Dr. Ines Levin and Dr. Michael Tesler at UCI. I expect to graduate attain my Ph.D. by 2024.\nHere is my CV, enjoy this site! You will find tabs for my current endevours, including service projects such as the UCI Womxn’s Caucus, and UCI Political Science Methods and Coding Reading Group!\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nOur continued aim for the Political Science Womxn’s Caucus has been to serve as a much-needed platform to engage with issues of diversity – race, gender, sexuality, etc. – through the lens of intersectionality. In our third year of the Womxn’s Caucus, we strive to strengthen our own department’s support of womxn graduate students and build new, diverse, interdisciplinary connections within the School of Social Sciences. As previously outlined, the Womxn’s Caucus serves a vital purpose in our department as a space which empowers womxn graduate students—helping them navigate their academic endeavors in a safe,comfortable environment that validates their everyday struggles and fosters their growth and learning. Please email me at mmuch@uci.edu or jtaghvai@uci.edu for invites to these events.\nEvent Schedule\nWelcome Event - November 6th 4:00 pm\nInvited Talk with Dr. Julia Jordan Zachery - December 8th\n\n\n\n",
