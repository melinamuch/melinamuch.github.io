In 2018 I also began working toward my Ph.D. in Political Science at UC Irvine, where I am investigating statistical methods for the study of political behavior and attidues using the framework intersectionality and multidimensional identities (namely race and gender). I am studying under Dr. Ines Levin and Dr. Michael Tesler at UCI. I expect to graduate attain my Ph.D. by 2024.\nHere is my CV, enjoy this site! You will find tabs for my current endevours, including service projects such as the UCI Womxn’s Caucus, and UCI Political Science Methods and Coding Reading Group!\n\n\n\n",
